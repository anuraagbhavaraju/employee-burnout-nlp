      "There was a notification of walkin interview on naukri.com , the company clearly mentioned , to show the notification to the ground floor security , other wise they'll not let you enter , I reached the company on time , the security guard asked me about the mail , I showed him the notification , but he refused to let me enter , I also told him that this is what companies permission is but still he refused , I showed him the date and venue in the notification but he did not bulge , on contrary he's behaviour was very rude, and seems to be throwing his weight around , when I asked him again he started raising his voice , shouting and misbehaving , I went to the watchmans manager who was seeing all this from distance , and he asked me to leave , I again politely explained him every thing , but he just showed me the gate , I had placed a leave for this interview , and came all the way from L B nagar , quite far away from hitec city, and this is what you get , and it's not just hcl , it happens in most of the multinationals , watchmans and security guards play important part in recruitment drive , as it's they who decide who should enter , who should not , and coming to hcl , if you don't want candidates to enter the building , please keep an HR in the security guard room itself , it might be helpful for both of us , the first 6 months were terrible, there may be in place pieces of training and other things but those who have gone through some technical concepts, you have already done that.\n"

      "I have gone through lot of them most of them are useless.Regarding the hike,there isn't even a hike There are 4 quarterly reviews to capture how good you performed in each quarter but it's just a fake game.Everyone in hcl gets almost same hike(usually 6-15%) I joined around 2019 with a fresher salary of 2.5LPA,Then got deployed to these scrap work .Somehow i got lucky .I influenced one of my customers they gave me some important work.Then i learnt and i left .But people who joined along with me are still there struggling to get exposure to market demanding skills.They are stuck and they are not getting any offers in thier hand.I left the organisation with a ctc of 2.6 LPA ie i got a hike of 10k for two years.my request to you is please investigate well and join Hcl Job security is ok here, would suggest to join HCL after 45 or 50 age, as there is no career growth prospects here in HCL.\n",
      "Manager's allways harassing their people mostly the manager came from Service Desk Management Salary - forget about that you will get hike every year , they do nothing increases, There is called quarterly performance review , they will give allways good rating all quarter but at the end of year like annual review they will mark down your review with out having any reason.\n",
      "Nothing There is no such thing that i like the work there because ther are no benefits provided to the employees and it is not employee centric The company has good working culture and also provides job security.\n",
      "As per my experience, Job security is there but working environment is worse, you are like a slave.\n",
      "Good work environment and culture.\n",
      "Company policies are good, appraisals are fair and they give good salary hike and bonus every year.\n",
      "job security: sometime luckily u get 1 yr, projects, mostly 3-6 month projects only so ready to attend customer interview often, if ur good in clearing it then fine, after 4 chances they ask u resign.\n",
      "Hcl Lucknow only can give you job security, it is not good place for anything else.\n",
      "However if you are a experienced resource who believes in a professional work environment, good work life balance, appriciation for your good job.\n",
      "I never recommend anyone to join this organization Hey I have a total work experience of almost 4 years where I found HCL is the company where I can spend time for me and with my family without any issue the work life balance is the ultimate thing in any environment where I found its abundant in my project.\n",
      "Job security is good.\n",
      "Since HCL is top 4 companies in terms of revenue Over 11 B and it's presence in 50+ countries why do they charge 2,38,000 from students stating candidate will be trained on software curriculum (which means Excel,access) works few concepts of programing and DBMS which cost less than 25k but why they charge 2.38L 2.When this program is in Australia they don't charge a single penny during 3 months which is foundation classes (if candidate feel ok of the curriculum then he goes ahead but here in India they ask you to go bank loan giving enough fake promises of not required to pay interest until u get job in HCL) which has raise my doubts on the program Since HCL is Hindustani computer limited company why they looting indian money rather they don't focus the same in Other countries bcz they feel Indians are fools 3.\n",
      "Good work environment and culture.\n",
      "Company policies are good, appraisals are fair and they give good salary hike and bonus every year.\n",
      "Work-Life balance and job security is good.\n",
      "So if you are looking for a job with avarage pay out and relaxed work with out any major upskilling, then its a good place for you.\n",
      "Company job security is better than other consulting firm such as Tech Mahindra but not as much as TCS, Infosys Company is good, perfect work life balance.\n",
      "I work here for salary and if a manager and organisation can cut a employee salary stating their performance both on monthly and annually.\n",
      "Job security is good, work culture - no much pressure or tight deadlines.\n",
      "Good work and environment and culture.temmates are supportive and the management is transparent.tjere is a huge cafeteria and gaming arcade for chilling .\n",
      "company policies are good , appraisals are fair and they give good salary hike and bonus every year Management is good work life balance is good.\n",
      "Not much growth in terms of skills you will be idle in most situations client is god for higher management Good company to start with but no great benefits are there if you are still in your 30s and are in need of a good package Company culture and word life balance is good but the compensation is not there Other companies do provide night shift allowance and pay on national holidays and festivals or at least provide gift to their employees but HCL do nothing like this just provide a comp off that's it that's something need to be changed You need to provide some strong reson to your employees to be in your company for longer period of time you have a job security here and can enjoy along with work as it has gym and games related options.\n",
      "But annual compensation will be not as per the expectation.Overall it is good with working and learning point of view but stay for long lasting will not keep the salary as expected.\n",
      "Job security is not there, worst management,, the HR also not supported for employees they only support for project lead, leads are using company policies in wrong way, I HCL not solve employees problems They only saw lead feedback.\n",
      "Only good thing that HCL offers is a job Security Regarding growth and other things it depends on the process to process.\n",
      "No other benefits, work culture and management will not help you to grow.\n",
      "Good work environment and culture.\n",

      "There was a notification of walkin interview on naukri.com , the company clearly mentioned , to show the notification to the ground floor security , other wise they'll not let you enter , I reached the company on time , the security guard asked me about the mail , I showed him the notification , but he refused to let me enter , I also told him that this is what companies permission is but still he refused , I showed him the date and venue in the notification but he did not bulge , on contrary he's behaviour was very rude, and seems to be throwing his weight around , when I asked him again he started raising his voice , shouting and misbehaving , I went to the watchmans manager who was seeing all this from distance , and he asked me to leave , I again politely explained him every thing , but he just showed me the gate , I had placed a leave for this interview , and came all the way from L B nagar , quite far away from hitec city, and this is what you get , and it's not just hcl , it happens in most of the multinationals , watchmans and security guards play important part in recruitment drive , as it's they who decide who should enter , who should not , and coming to hcl , if you don't want candidates to enter the building , please keep an HR in the security guard room itself , it might be helpful for both of us , the first 6 months were terrible, there may be in place pieces of training and other things but those who have gone through some technical concepts, you have already done that.\n",
