4,Hyderabad/Secunderabad,"With growing experience, work would be very hectic. The base of Employee hierarchy triangle is being flattened out and hence one person is being assigned multiple projects as well in some cases. If you are fresher you could be on bench for longer times.",3,4,Senior Sap Consultant,2,4-Jan-22,"1. Unlimited opportunities to switch skill when u want to upskill or cross skill. 2. Work from Home (9 days a month) is a company policy for us even before Covid. 3. Work from office (through swipes) can be also be managed through something called ""On-duty"". So by using 2 & 3 we can almost avoid the campus hours. 4. Trainings are good and they push u towards upskilling. 5. Campus - u dont feel like u r in office. Hyd STP campus makes u feel relaxed as if u r in a park once u come out of your building. 6. Most importantly JOB SECURITY.",5,1,Infosys,"1. One thing that overhelms you with disastrous feeling, overcoming all the pros, is EMPLOYEE BENFITS. For ex: when it accomplished 25 years journey, we were given Tshirts, just t shirts with Infosys logo and nothing else. Every year during Diwali, they will give you water bottle etc. etc which gets u the feeling of YUCK. They willask u to be part of recruitment process for an entire day during weekend WITHOUT ANY PAY. 2. They dont pay you with market standards. 3. VERY LESS HIKES - Even if you have an extraordinary profile and got a CTC in par with market standards during joining, u will be left far behind from market standards of ""Experience to CTC"" quotient after few years inside. 4. THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING - When I was the best performer consecutively for 2 years and when the client VICE PRESIDENT by himself shouted loud that this guy is extraordinary they gave me a gift voucher of 500 Rs. That time i got 2% hike after which i had to fight like bull to get what i deserve. 5. Whatever they do, directly/indirectly benefits Infosys but not the employee. 6. You need to be a MARK ZUCKERBURG / STEEVE JOBS for you to get an OUTSTANDING (1+) rating. ( Being best in ur technical capacities to resolve any kind of complex issue, which 99.9% people were not good at in IT industry, will just give you MET EXPECTATIONS (2) rating. U r expected to give service improvement ideas to client and upskill urself every year along with certifications & skill tags. Even that will give you only 1 (Commendable) rating. 7. They dont care to stop even the best of the best techies from moving out. I mean they may ask u but wont offer the same package what u have in hand. THAT IS WHY IT IS IN SECOND PLACE IN THE LIST OF COMPANIES WITH HIGHEST ATTRITION RATE.",3,5

Here as an fresher you'll get groomed to the corporate life here you'll meet new people who becomes family more than friends, work culture here is are good, in some projects needs improvement management. You'll less hike percentage in early years. Policies are best here, they take care of each and everything and it benefits you to have secure and stress free work life balance.",4,4,Infosys,"Companies take much time to take any decision. Most of time it delays in promoting employees and provide hike in their salaries, they follow batch rule due to which most of the employee has to wait for next quarter to get hike/promotion. After training in Mysore, they'll assign to any project irrespective of your skills or learningat Mysore. Which change the your whole career path. If you want to choose your own primary technology project then you've to get certified and then only they'll move you else project manager will not release you in most cases.",5,5
1,Bengaluru/Bangalore,"There is no work-life balance now and even before COVID there was none. Pre COVID, only boss' favourites would get WFH. Boss is sadistic so artificial deadlines will spoil your weekends. If you are adept at politics you should definitely join.",1,1,Corporate Strategy Analyst,1,3-Feb-22,Infosys BPM is a service line of Infosys Ltd. So dont mistake it for the actual Infosys. Overall very hierarchial company and most employees are home-growns. You get respect only if you are MBA from IIMs does not matter old IIM or new IIM or baby IIM. The company sells macros calling them automation so you can imagine why senior management expects all analysis and reporting on only Excels.,1,1,Infosys,"If you are male or from IIM or Malayali then only you can expect good projects or growth in Corporate Strategy team at Infosys BPM. The team is managed by two female middle aged ladies who are not even Btech or MBAs but prefer only IIM grads. They are autocratic, unethical, extremely unprofessional who like ppl in the team who can feed their petty politics. And reporting their partial and unethical ways to management are hardly of any use since they are very close to the C-suite. Employee Relations team will close such cases hurriedly without even any proper investigation. But if you can bootlick unabashedly for years you can expect extreme growth. One lady, who cannot use Excel properly, even got CEO award after years of putting up with shit. She was also able to switch over (normally not allowed due to historic hostile relations between Infosys BPM and Infosys Ltd) to parent company Infosys Ltd where she reports into her own HUSBAND!! So, you can imagine the current prevalent culture at all Infosys companies.",1,1
2,Pune,Work like balance is relaxed. There isn't much work to be honest. But get into Infy at the level of a lead or manager when the pay is good.,3,2,Senior System Engineer,2,18-Aug-21,Worked here for more than 3 years. You will be welcomed with an excellent induction program followed by an excellent training. All good things end once you end your training and get deployed to production.,1,1,Infosys,"Post deployment you either slog in bench for months or get allocated to a project, everything depends on your luck. Deployment mostly occurs in very old production support projects with very little to 0 scope of learning. The very lucky once get into development units (FSSTAR, STG, AINADEL) these are some I remember. All other unitsare bodyshops with decades old support projects like for example ORCALL, CISRUN. The bridge programs (PP, Acon) all these are just gimmicks, you will be stuck in a 'yes I will get selected next time' trap. IJP's are terrible, you apply but get no calls from anyone and finally get auto rejected after some days. If you are able to clear any of these two either PP or Acon, believe me you are at the wrong place with a wrong compensation. Try for MBA from tier 1 colleges or start preparing for FAANG interviews. Then comes the famous compensation. You can get 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5% hike depending on how good your relation is with the upper management. Yes they have good campuses, swimming pools , gyms, steam rooms, sauna rooms, fields and green campuses. But these won't put bread and butter on your table at the end of the day. They give you slow old dell laptops which are worthy of becoming antiques in few days. In the era of 11th gen processors and ssds those have 5th or 6th gen proc and slow HDD. And yes good luck raising a replacement request for RAM, laptop or other things. Their internal service center or the so called CCD must be made a government department. Even government offices work faster. I once had to escalate a request to the level of regional manager to get things done. This is level of resistance you get to face. People just don't want to work. Finally if you want my two cents of advice. Complete the training very seriously and then instead of wasting your time start preparing for SDE interviews of product companies. Never waste more than 2 years if you get into units other than the above mentioned development units.",4,4

If you are a fresher or 2-3years exp nobody cares about your career or growth. They will try to make sure you dont learn much so that you dont switch to a good company and be there for years getting chillars in hike. They will ask for entries for certification paid by the company. when you will give names they will tell your job level is low and we have only funds for higher job level people even if you have worked there for 2 years. It all comes to luck here. your stream your location your unit your project your team your manager. If you are lucky you might get good things but if you luck is not good your career will be in dark and depression will be waiting for you. Try to switch as early as possible if you get good package.when you will resign even if you have given full efforts in your work they will tell we can offer you 10 percent hike and in most cases they wont even bother.,3,5

Infosys is very good , no doubt about that - at the end everything depends on the project you get - your project decides the scope of your technical growth . Also when I was on bench , there was a fantastic program which I was involved into called Accelerate , it's like working in a project itself - the projects let out their tasks for people on bench to improve their skills and it was very useful. It never felt like I am on bench and idle , lot of opportunities present. Also lot of onsite opportunities, many of my team mates got onsite opportunity, I didn't take for personal reasons",4,5,Infosys,"Getting release from a project should not be obstructed by managers , attrition rate is high because people don't like project and the work they are doing - nowadays people don't think twice about their profile getting ruined before resigning if they're not happy with the work they do - And money is not the only thing for which people change jobs",4,5
3,Chandigarh,,4,3,Senior Systems Engineer,4,20-Mar-22,I joined Infosys as a fresher. Training period here is one of the best experience you can get. After training ends the real corporate life starts and that does not have anything to do with your training. You can get aligned with any project which I think is a good way to get experience in different technologies. Like I got training in BI/SSIS/SSRS and then later got a project in Informatica. Overall it was a nice 3 years for me. To get a clear picture of how a corporate world look like you can join here. Great learning experience and a decent option to start your corporate life.,3,2,Infosys,Chances of growth are very low even after 1 year of probation period. It becomes very difficult to move out of one project and switch to other. Managers are like old school who have their own theories and poor management skills like in the replacement of 8-10 years experienced person(TL) they will bring a complete fresher into the project which eventually increase pressure on rest of the team as workload increases and in the end due to imbalance in team rest of the people also leave (this is my personal experience).,3,5

This mean we have lot of job security joining there.,2,1,Infosys,If you join Infosys as a fresher you know you are a person who like to take up challenges. The training is so difficult. If you fall in a developement project with no proper knowledge transfer sessions you are done. Only if you are a genius you will be able to understand their flow. And also the shift times are vague when it comes towork from home. If there is a bug we have to solve it as soon as possible as the client may be unhappy. They are always more concerned about client satisfaction than employees expectations. The salary growth is also very slow and minimal percentage.,1,5

Zero Team collaboration. No one will help you but everyone wants you to work on their task. Wont care about employee's personal life. Zero work life balance during covid WFH. Even if you work for 14 hrs it wont be enough for them. Blame game will be there. If there is appreciation it will be looted by Leads, Managers. If something went wrong they will blame people with comparitively lesser experience. They wont promote you to Analyst. I can see Analysts with 12+ years experience also. If you are from infosys and have 4+ exp you will be promoted to analyst. No learning from team. Set of 12+ exp people are there ruining the work culture. They will simply assign tasks. Wont help and enable the work. Simply wants us to do A to Z. They wont even join scrum calls, grooming calls with PO. Multiple heads will be there. Lead will assign task. Project Manager will assign task. Test Manager will assign task. Senior Technical Manager will assign task. People will jump without following hierarchy and assign task.

Employees are expected to work 12hrs+ a day without providing necessary help. In my case, my manager herself had little Idea about the project. One time I had to change the entire work I've done and start from scratch because of the lack of clarity in task description provided by higher authority.

Unit system :They have a ""not so well organized Unit system"" which has too many flaws in it, I wondered how no one from higher management is not noticing that. For ex. : There are separate unit for developers called ADM and a separate unit for Testers called ""IVS"". Now one ADM manager can pick a tester from bench and change his/her unit to ADM and now a tester is part of ADM unit. In the very beginning looks ok one has to do his/her job let it be any unit. But no, it is not like that, now this tester will get less opportunities in terms of learning, hike, performance , onsite opportunity in compare to other testers from IVS unit. 2. There will be a cold war between managers of ADM and IVS if they are part of same project and if above mentioned situation is there in that project/account. And trust me this impacts other resources too and overall org performance. 3.Very poor compensation and yearly hike. 4.Pay cut in your performance pay based on your rating, I consider that totally unethical, because based on individuals rating your upcoming hike has to be decided. if employee is working in a project and organization is performed well then employee deserved his variable pay(performance pay). 5.Delay in promotions. 6. They charged for every facility they provided, nothing comes for free. Be it Gym or Parking everything is chargeable.(600Rs per month for Car Parking). 7. You have to stay in campus for 9.25 Hrs, no matter if you have any work or not, no matter if you have finished your tasks, no matter if you are on bench and you don't have any desk to sit, you have to maintain avg 9.25 office hours monthly.",4,5

HR doesn’t even check on their assigned employees once in a year. 6. Bootlickers only will get first rating and good hike. 7. On-site employees don’t respect the offshore employees. 8. No transparency in the project work.,2,3
4,Pune,,3,3,Senior Systems Engineer,3,15-Apr-22,The infrastructure and learning facilities are top notch.,3,2,Infosys,"The compensation provided is low for freshers. If one is hired for a starting package of 3.6 lpa, he/she will need around 2 years to get 30k in hand salary. The growth aspects are not great. It is almost impossible to shift from a technical role to a non technical role. Would not recommend joining as a fresher.",4,5

Got good helping seniors and lead.,4,4,Systems Engineer,4,23-Feb-22,"As my 1st Company, it was a good experience learning technologies and working with big clients. Their training problem is good even non-IT like me will get a good amount of knowledge of coding.",4,3,Infosys,Pay is slightly lower according to current market value and other competitors.

4,Hyderabad/Secunderabad,Not great. Someone above you will push their work down on you and if you raise concerns then you are banished,2,2,Architect,2,20-Mar-21,"Lots of good training materials. This by the way, they have monetized and are using it as a subscription model for college students also and earning bug bucks. All the socialism of NRN applies to salary only, rest everything in infy is of capitalist culture",1,1,Infosys,"(1)They talk a lot about internal job rotations, career moves; it's all a sham. Resource managers simply do not allow employees to join desired opportunities because they have SLA to place them within a certain time, and also want to retain them within business unit even if the skills don't match. (2) Very hierarchy driven. Deliverymanager holds the budget, promotion, onshore travel. They don't care about your skills and capability. For them everyone is a body which can be replaced (hence body shopping). (3) Strangely they collect rs 50 as parking charges per day for four wheelers within their campus. (4) huge employee base of 2 lakhs plus, makes it tough to find right answers for your queries. Years will go away trying to find out the right department. (5) they delay hikes and promotion. Usually apply it retroactively. For ex. In March 2021, they would give hikes that apply from Jan 2021. So u have to wait till March to know your hike. If not happy, then 3 month's notice period. So you end up wasting 6 months of your career. (6) once you take a release from a project, they backdate your allocation. This makes your utilisation less and also in bench on a backdate. This hampers appraisal",2,4

The only thing that is bad. Compensation is very low compared to other competitors such as Accenture, cognizant, and ibm. On avg you will get 22.5 k for first year. Even after 1.5 year experience, you will be getting 32.5k gross and 27.5k in-hand which is very low . Only join infosys if you don't have any other options.

You are treated as a headcount or just a number and not as a person. 2. Even if you have health related issues sometimes you have to prove that it is critical and only then you can take sick leave. 3. Ratings are most of the time biased depending on the manager's relation with the individuals and not by your performance. 4. Youare not given chance to work on new technologies. 5. You are not encouraged to learn new things (if the technology you are interested in is not related to your current role) 6. Once you put down papers HR and managers suddenly realize your worth, and shamelessly make false promises of sending you to onsite. And these promises are made to every single person serving notice period. 7. Employees are not respected at all.",2,3

Because people with less skills can survive there too due to it's reputation and being big company with lots of projects. We can't expect growth in all domains and u can't choose ur domain as like in Infosys if u join as fresher. You can't work on things based on u rinterest because u r manger decides what u have to do. But the thing is u can maintain work life balance in most of the domains upto my knowledge. People in the most of the domains are saying they don't like the nature of work they are doing. I don't know how it will be in the other companies.,3,3,Infosys,For the freshers they are throwing people into different streams they didn't give any chance to express the employees intrest.,4,4

Management will blame only on you if anything goes wrong at the end of a project even the management or senior level says ok on daily activities. Salary and appraisal is the very worst part. For the revenue which they have got in past years and giving their employees a very low % and no promotions is a big worst part. Salary System : Please read the below before accepting the offer and joining at Infosys which no one explained me clearly to me before joining Infy. Your salary : 63,000 per month, Take Home : 49,000 to 50,000 ( PF , Income tax and look below) 6300 will be taken from your salary by INFY for 2 months. At the 3rd month (which is named as QUARTER 1..n), based on the performance of you in this QUARTER, 6300 X 3 = 18,900 , If u work well 98% = 13K TO 14K will be credited. Your own salary will come to you in the name of Performance Bonus based on your work performance % for a QUARTER. As a result at the end of QUARTER you will get 49K OR 50k + (PB) 13k = 60K+ as your salary. Your offer letter package defined salary will be given to you for 3 months once only. This will be worst part if someone comes into infy without knowing this system. Politics is always there anywhere. Work Life Balance is Worst part. You should be working 20 hours for a week continuously. If you avoid you will be getting a threatening statement which can be a danger alarm like statement as ""THE PROGRESS IS WATCHED BY HIGHER END OFFICIALS"" sometimes if requirements meets deadline which is not the exact estimation of delivery which will be defined without any discussion with development team.

It is almost as if the company wants to punish loyalty and incentivize company hoping. Staying at Infosys for a long duration is a monetary suicide. This is definitely an opinion since Infosys has a mammoth of a workforce and its only fair to consider seldom will two experiences be similar. The management attitude towards the employees feels stripped down of any empathy, there have been dozens of instances when we are made to feel like mere numbers on the sheet, just 'resources'.

1,,very bad. Nothing i learned at Infosys.,1,1,Project Manager for 2 years in Hyderabad,1,29-Jul-19,"First of all NARAYANA MURTHY SIR is very great and he is an inspiration for those who are working in IT industry: I quit Infosys because of the following reasons: 1. First the recruitment process is not proper. I was recruited as a java technical manager, and i was on 6 months on bench. Later i was put up in a support project which is not related to my skills. My suggestion to Infosys is please place the associates in the projects with their respective skill sets. 2. Second thing is the salary structure which was divided into 3 areas individual, unit and organization level. Infosys is very smart to deduct salary by giving reasons saying that unit level/Organization level was not performed in the past quarter etc. Associates used to get disappointed. Even Finance minister also cannot understand INFOSYS pay slip. 3. Third point is I felt INFOSYS is like a school. Wearing TIE, maintaining 9 HOURS per day. As most of the associates used to spend time in cafeteria rather than at workstations. 4. Organization process and the tools are very complicated, for example if a person is thirsty and need a glass of water. Management asks first to raise a TICKET in the tool and then glass of water will be served to that person. 5. Think like a product companies and make the process easier. 6. Need to write technical, process exams in every 6 months. This is highly rediculous. Please make sure associates who are learning the things while working in their projects and try to groom them up by providing trainings and giving moral support. Finally my experience @ Infosys: 1. Skill Development & Learning : ZERO (0) 2. Work Life Balance : WORST , ZERO (0) 3. Compensation & Benefits : Nothing, except that cafeteria and the greenary. 4. Company Culture: Process is very complex, and tools are more which is not required. 5. Work satisfaction: ZERO(0)",1,1,Infosys,Very bad experience @ Infosys. Nothing i learned.,1,1

Rest, Managers are shitty; apply low leveltactics to get their work done even if it is weekend; cheap cost cutting tactics ;the higher management is arrogant and worst uneducated of all.

Coming to work experience, well.. the project in which I was a member wasn't that good.. team was very strange and definitely work environment won't be good if your teammates are not friendly or professional.. Coming to the location of the office - Infosys has one office in outskirts of the city.. so people residing near the city can forget getting a project in the office which is in the city. Unless you have strong contacts with the higher management. So you might also have to travel for 2 hours to go to work and to come back to your home which will leave you with zero work-life balance. And mind you guys, under no circumstances HRs will transfer you to the city office, unless you get a project there.",3,

Down the line after few years , we either get frustration to work their or we just compromise and continue working for monetary benefits. Its very hard to identify and convince the right person who could listen , think , understand & analyse our skills and gives us opportunity to work in the right domain so that we could perform to the best for the growth of the company.

Another plus point is that my colleagues come from various cultural backgrounds, and we work happily in collaboration. I also like the employee re-hire policy here.",5,5,Infosys,"growth is slow. The work pressure is very high. Sometimes, I have to work 14-18 hours straight in a day as I have to attend client calls in the evening and sometimes late into the night.

I do receive appreciationemails from my client, but they mostly go unnoticed during my mid-year appraisals. Also, there is no on-job training for freshers, hence senior folks like me have to guide them step-by-step, which is a pain sometimes.",4,5

It is divided into Two. One is Infosys Limited and another one is Infosys BPO Limited. Not only there is a Difference in the Name that you see above but also there is a drastic Discrepancy in terms of Remuneration, Facilities and Benefits.Sharing my personal experience: I sat for Infosys Drive and I cleared 4 rounds as it is an Off Campus. And I was being told that ""You are being hired for Infosys Limited"" After I submitted all my Original Documents for verification before I go for Induction and training that takes place in Mysore, at the end moment I was being told that ""We dont have any batch vacancies now for Infosys Limited so nothing to worry, you can work for Infosys BPO Limited.Later on if you want you can change your domain to Infosys Limited through IJP (Internal Job change)"" Me being a fresher without knowing much difference about it, I agreed to be associated with IBPO.",1,1,Infosys,"After the Induction and Training in Mysore then I was allocated for Intel Project. Its been 11 months in Infosys and these are the following things that will demoralize you before you step into Infosys BPO: - Extremely less Salary and top of that you will have more deductions. For Freshers in hand salary is 12,500/- and includingall obscure deductions you will be left with not more than 11,000/-. Whereas in Infosys Limited, an employee earns 28000 to 30000 being freshers. - Shift Allowances Facility is much more favorable to IL as compared to IBPO. IL earns 250 per afternoon shift everyday and 350 in night shift everyday. whereas in IBPO, if you work for the entire month in night shift you will be only paid 1200 to 1300. - Good Appraisal for IL and negligible appraisal for IBPO. It is actually an Insult to be a part of Infosys BPO unlike other companies where there is no Discrepancy.",1,3

1,Mangalore,-,1,1,Senior System Engineer,1,15-Aug-18,There is nothing good about Infosys. Those who say it's good are the one's who got everything when they did not deserve it.,1,1,Infosys,1. Those whose coding skills are good are always put into projects which are completely manual. And those who struggle in coding are given multiple development projects just because they are manager's favourite. 2. If managers don't like you then they will make you sit late in office by asking you to maintain ODC hours so that you will not get time to prepare for any exams/interviews. 3. Work culture is very bad. Managers support egoistic employees more than the team players. The one's whose sole purpose is to prove they are genius and the best are always rewarded and those who motivate and build the team are often not given the credit they deserve. 4.Many are usually asked to quit the job if they ask for promotion/hike/projects. This happens in DCs situated in the places where there are no other companies and the person has family there.,1,1

Who the hell take parking charges from their own employees?",3,1,Infosys,"If you have 9 different objectives for a year and you complete 8, have great reviews from teammates, you get the lowest possible rating because you didn't complete one. You don't get promotion because you've worked on 3 different application, did automation demo for the clients though not being an automation resource, come to officeand give KT to new joinees though your doctor has ordered you for a month's bedrest, because all these are freaking expected. On other note, there are people with 2 objectives for a year, get highest rating, performance bonus, promotion all at once. The objectives are: on time deliverables and being POC for the project work you're currently doing. Don't know to laugh or cry on this. Only one word: lucky. You need to be freaking lucky to have everything going for you without breaking much of a sweat. Minimal deserving people get what they deserve.",2,4

Before joining confirm the work that is going to be given to you.",3,1,Technology Analyst,2,11-Jun-19,The training provided in Infosys is amazing. Other than that nothing is as good as expected from a company of this stature. Infrastructure is very good and you enjoy your time there if you can since work life balance doesn't exist,2,4,Infosys,"The very first thing is the ineffectiveness of the employees who are supposed to help you with miscellaneous processes for eg. When you need to go abroad, the team doesn't have enough knowledge to provide assistance. Another problem is the work-life balance which is not there since working hours are kept flexible. HR are no help ismost of the cases and it all depends on the managers so if you're found a little bit on the downside with your manager, that's it for atleast 2 years unless you leave the company. This leads to politics rather than talent development which is terrible in Infosys. If you want to join Infosys, make a plan to leave the company in 1 year even if you don't want to leave since that insurance will definitely be coming in handy and there will be less regrets later on.",1,3

Though no much leaves are given , even if you take 3 days leave for genuine reason , they will call you and ask you to work.

1,Hyderabad,boring,2,1,Qa Test Analyst,1,11-May-18,"I worked with Infosys Hyderabad. I am not sure if this situation is location specific or company specific but working at Infosys was not Good, atleast for me. Cons : 1. Managers and lead have the sole power. So even if you are working hard, smart or whatever, if they are not happy your career at Infosys is doomed.they may also eatup your job. 2.leave policy is shit here. you get 4 leaves in 3 months.No concept of EL,PL,SL,CL. workforce here is so used to this, that they don't feel like taking any leaves from office even in the long run. 3.Atleast my colleagues were NOT supportive. I asked for help, asked for basics, what i only got were scoldings. they will show their eagerness to help, but will never help. 4. the most hostile crowd of workforce live here. Everyone is ready to eat you up. People are highly rude to say the least. for every genuine excuse you will provide, they have alot of questions to ask on it. Sometimes you will never be able to explain the real situation and its just like you are standing in court of law justifying yourself. 5.Maintaining 9.25 hours without work. So whether you are with work or without work, you are always expected to maintain these 9:25 hours in the office. It becomes terrible as without work it seems an uphill task. You don't have a dedicated system to read/work or study on it. After the whole day, it becomes so boring and tiring to go home and study. 6. I agreed with the HR to leave the company without any experience letter as she said she will get it done and delivered. Though i requested her several times, still she insisted and maintained that she will do it. I got my relieving letter from the company after multiple mails, calls and 3-4 visits to the office. 7.work from home is not the option here. You have to apply on duty seperately.

I will be forever in Infosys' debt for that. But what the company did after I came into production made me hate. Also, some managers are psychopaths. They derive joy from hurting and mentally torturing others. And, the employee benefits was zero. I am a hard-working and dedicated person, but I thought what was the point of working hard when it didn't benefit you in a way. Most frustrating thing was lateral joinees with loss less skill and experience in a higher position that me. Summarizing, it's a good company to start. But as soon as it's 1.5-2 years, start packing your bags coz you'll be instigating your own descent",1,1,Infosys,Everything. No benefits in any way,3,4

Other things that might interest someone coming from diferrent company(say accenture or IBM) are yhe facilities inside the campus. One might get surprised to see the gym facilities, sports facilities and accomodation(provided upto 3 months on short term transfer) which are all world class.",2,1,Infosys,"Like many other service based companies it is the company where working late is considered a virtue. An employee who has completed a set of tasks in 4-6 hours will be valued less than his counterpart who has completed same set of tasks in say 9-10 hours. The later will also get a better hyke. The productivity of an employee accordingto Infosys is directly proportional to the number of hours spent in front of the system. As far as salary hykes are concerned it is the worst company to work for. The transparency sysyem is very poor, one will never get to know why the person sitting next yo you has got good hyke than you. Now let us talk about the projects and the work that one will be doing if he/she is planning to join the Infosys. Most of the projects in infosys are either support projects or enhancement projects. The managers will try and lure you into their projects by taking names of the technologies which are niche these days( say spark or big data), but whne you will get into the project you will see that the project is rarely 1-2% of these technologies, a work which if you teach to the security guard sitting outside, he will be able to do it easily. Getting into a project is easy, getting a release is the most dramatic part. No matter what you do , what your condition is, if you have asked for release you will not get it for 2-3 months atleast( a person who has not asked for release might get it sooner than you) provided you have some solid reason.",3,3

After working so many years there is less opportunity for carrier growth(i.e. Promotion and Onsite opportunity). Regarding onsite opportunity mangers always play biased role in that and give opportunity to their favorites one.

There are innovations but only on emails and papers not in reality.,2,2,Infosys,Salary deduction from variable part (i.e managers play biased role in that). Parking Charges for infosys own campus.

The management really never hide's things from you or from all. The company is very through and the processes are the same. Various departments do come with their challenges, but after working on projects you get the hang of it. Our team serves as a support group to various clients across all geographical areas, the work we do is fun, exciting, challenging, and relaxing. The management is really supportive at times and very understanding. Life in the company is like living in your own little city,. They have a lot of outdoor activities spaces, they have various gyms, you can also relax in the meditation room or you can laze around in the food courts. They have their own little supermarket, swimming pool dormitory's for employees to rest. Also their own guest rooms for employees, chargeable to whoever wishes to stay during the holidays or weekends, fine dining restaurants and a lot of food options to choose from. You name it, they have it. Work culture is not like the stock market where every minute counts. And yes there are a few projects which is truly heavy, as they follow time management really seriously. But there are projects which have a very relaxed pace of work. There's a saying within the company ""The company will never throw you out unless you really goof up badly"". But still you will be placed on bench until you get a next project. So job security is really good. Growing within the company is like fishing in a pond, there are endless IJP's that come, if your criteria matches, go for it..",5,4,Infosys,"Every project has their own way of working, some are highly pressured and some are really relaxing with work with. Being in support you need to be flexible according to clients requirements. At one point the work does become monotonous you do the same work day in and day out. There are amenities like the gym, swimming pool, bowlingalley etc, but those are usually for the people who are having no projects or who are really free. Not everybody gets to enjoy the facilities. At times the management can be a real pain especially when you wanting a leave. Learning within the process does take time. Every company has positives every company has negatives it is up to you how you take it every company has the same way of working It is up to you how do you take work pressure.",5,5

If you don't have work, I will give you, we are representing infy here, you have to follow same work env here as well"". These were the words of my lead. Now my point is if I have finish my work why can't I go to gym. And worst nightmare came when my manager and reviewer took review from my lead and evaluated me, how the hell I will be evaluated well in this case?. It happened like that only , I got 2/5 rating. 90%of the defects are solved by Google baba, there are some leads who really have technical knowledge, but some are so pathetic that, being lead their answers would be ""I don't know this, Google it"".

The biggest support we got is the job security. When number of MNCs are revising it's policy to fire it's employees because of number of projects are getting ramped down which results in losses, there is no sign of fire from Infy. Not only job security, but also helping financially ,either for the new Wi-Fi connection made at home for WFH, or for the internet bill on monthly basis. It's gives a great feeling when infy sent a new HP laptop (pro-book) costing around 75000 to 80000 via courier to my home to work. Not only financially, but it has supported mentally also through regular mental health session. Academically, it has also supported like making available all the courses for certification in its own app called Lex... And many more....

Once you get tagged into a project wait for another 1 -2month to get a seat and system for that you will have to beg the floor anchors but in those 1-2 months waiting time you are expected to work and deliver for that you can use a common working area but you will get a seat only if you are lucky as most of the systems are tagged to other projects or not working, forget getting a laptop for 1.5 years, depending on your projects timings you may or may not be able to avail the shuttle facility and your managers won't give a shit about it,I was denied the facility even though my working hours got aver at 10:45 pm. There is no guarantee that you will get your night shift allowance as due to system glitch(thats what they said) I never received mine for 1 month. After 6pm they shut down the AC and lights, I had worked for months in that dark suffocating environment for months. As the work culture is so informal there is always improper flow of information and regular blame game. Just to save costs they put me in 24*7 project with no allowance, no backup resource and guess what no laptop. After 6pm cafeteria closes you are on your own.

And there is no use on raising this to your manager or senior manager or HR or HR head. 8. Worst Mentors. My TL was very poor, he was internally selected as TL by my manager. He didn't know the process well and did not take proper training from internal members. We all were in shock to see him as our TL with lack of knowledge in process and lack of interest in Job. Such is the management and seniors there. 9.No work from home is allowed. 10. You have to compulsory give 9 hrs 15mins every day in the campus.

4,Hyderabad,,2,2,Senior Systems Engineer,3,2-Oct-20,"It's a good starting place as a fresher, the initial training was good. One can learn even not having a C.S degree. Infosys has a well developed learning portal, courses available are vast and easy to learn. Working culture/work life balance depends from project to project.",3,1,Infosys,"Infosys has irked me in so many ways.. 1) if you begin as a fresher, you need to be the top performer or high performer in the training period (first 4-5 months) because even after training , the bonus, salary and even promotion gets accelerated based on that ""training"" ranking (which clearly is unacceptable) A normal performer will be promoted to Technical analyst in 4 years , but a top performer gets promoted within 3 years(mind you top performer(tpf) is based on your performance in the initial training and they also get more salary than normal performer).even though your performance improved starkly after training , it doesn't get reflected in salary until your manager takes action,by default tpf has accelerated career growth. 2) Client is treated like God, one can clearly see the difference in working standards in projects b/w infy and client developers. Infy doesn't mind their employees overworking but infact insists on normalising it. 3) Career growth is slow, irritatingly slow. 4) Infosys believes more head count over experience. Replacing experienced people more often with inexperienced developers. Financially it could be helpful, but resulting into increased stress on developers, rework,delayed and poor quality of work. 5) personally I was in 3 different development projects within the same client and I found all of the projects limping or in escalation and stressfull, under managed or micromanaged, but nothing worked, maybe infy should train their managers well. 6) this is my experience in infy for about 3 years where I worked under one huge client in different projects, could be possible that other projects are doing well but still infy should try to maintain a good standard well across all the units.",3,4
