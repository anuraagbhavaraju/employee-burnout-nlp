1,Its good and managable only because of team.,Lucknow,"Fake offers were given while recruiting. Wrong information about oppotunities were given. No transparency and equality. Favouritism and partially runs between managment. Hardly any monetary benefits is given. If you ask about appraisal, compensation and bonus then they will start making excuses. During my interview i was told that after completion of 2 and 3 yr i will get bonus bit when now i ask about same they say that there is no policy for same and noy applicable to employees who are in HRSC since beginning. Even retention bonus is also given only basis of recommendation. Salary hike is nothing, no reimbursement of fuel for lower band employees. If you want early release than be ready to go ahead with no. Of faltu ka processes. I will never recommend anyone to join HCL if they are expecting salary/monetary benefit. But if you want to learn then most welcome. In terms of training, you have to complete same mandatory training yrly, but no skill enhancement training for junior level employees. Good hike is distributed amongst mid and senior level while peanuts are distributed amongst juniors. If i say that HCL exploit resources in some lications than i would not be wrong, because many of us cant leave city due to personal reasons and they hire us in min salary.

There is no option to rate below 1 for compensation & benefits and job oppotunities otherwise could have given the same.. Salary differes from location wise even if you are doing same job what other are doing just because of different location.,3,21-Apr-22,4,1,4,HCL Technologies,Hr Executive,1
4,Very balanced and rarely pressuring.,Noida,* Although it's WFH as of now but no general transportation available. * Compensation & Hikes are not as per market standards. Promotions are uncertain too. HRs willing to give higher CTC to new joiners. Variable pay is very high and is released very late. * Uneven hierarchies; you may find new joiners with less experience having senior designation! This also impact team set-ups when changing projects. * System time monitoring tool - this is really annoying as there are days when there is not much to do except some calls and it reports less time like seriously you need to sit and face laptop screen for 8hrs daily ü§¶üèª,2,5,"Overall good experience for me! Very much secured in terms of job security. Work life balance is just as per my expectation during WFH. Technical growth & work pressure completely depends on your project and seniors. You can find yourself in any kind of project. Salary is on time. Other perks - working/ interview weekend allowance, phone& internet bill reimbursement, no leave/month benefit etc. Onsite/transfer opportunities are there but very few and rare (depends on client/project as well). HCL Healthcare - you can avail cashless preventive health checkups (in addition to group mediclaim policy) for you as well as dependents. Benefit Box - So many corporate privileges due to brand tie-ups.",4,16-Apr-22,5,4,3,HCL Technologies,Technical Lead,4

1,Too bad for a mid level experienced. Enquire properly before joining the roles & responsibilities from your close circle. Because hr or the interviewer won't reveal the exact work nature. I was told that it is a npd work but what I was is into,Chennai,Work culture is too bad and experienced so many mind games and politics from the team mates. Earlier during 2010 to 2013 the company culture was good. We will receive more appreciations and rewards for our good work. But later this rewards and recognition got reduced and they will share a print out for a reward rather than a certificate. The project I was working was a new client and I was referred by few of my ex-colleague. But they played too many mind games and influenced other team mates to follow the same. Later I raised a complaint regarding this to my project manager and then it gradually reduced. I have been warned not to join HCL before joining from my previous employer. But I made a wrong decision joining here. After that I got transferred to a new project due to some personal reasons and there it was even worst. The current project I'm is in client location and even my manager just does the same job as like me. Here mostly the managers are the people who are very close to the project managers here and they just have to follow what project managers says. Managers here don't have people management work but they get involved only in appraisals and leaves. They don't even know or show interest on what you are working or on your strengths to place you in right project. For these managers only billing is important and they don't bother what kind of work you do. My manager instructs me to be online all the time not to miss a single ping from client or we may lose you. Since I'm in a client location I cannot ask for a better work for me as they treat me as just a resource and not like what I'm capable of. I have around 11 years of product design and development experience. But because of this company I have been placed in a project where they actually don't need such a experienced person and can be done by a 2 year or even freshers. But my total experienced got wasted here and I almost forgot all my past learnings.,1,2,It is a growing organization and has multiple mechanical engineering projects currently. Many of the team size grow rapidly based on the skilled top management. Top management and sales team gets more benefits here in HCL.,1,09-Dec-21,4,1,1,HCL Technologies,Senior Technical Lead,1
1,Is there anything called work life balance here!??..this colum is a joke,Chennai,Why not paying your employees good!? .Stop overloading them they have families too.Don't eat their own money.Also are you people aware of the fact that how difficult it is to get approval for a claim!?? I bought a ups and tried to claim the bill two times.But it got revert back again and again then i stop tried claiming.if I ask about something to the manager he will ask me to check with hr and if i ask to hr he will ask me to check with manager.Most of the HRs doesn't know the policies.Lastly stop pushing employees to learn the skills they don't like.Most of courses in the portal are waste.I spend hours of time in completing them but final result is nothing.Please take care this point.I know Hcl is a very good organization.but the middle management is worst.kindly appoint some humans with heart(not stone). Hcl need some managers who knows their employees.Also stop hanging around every company as cringe. Hcl has enough potential and employee strength to make their own products.Pleaese consider these points do the needful immediately otherwise HCL will keep on loosing talents.,4,1,"Hcl is avery good organization,But the middle management is shit. You wil get career growth if you joined in internal projects.If it is a service-based project (external project from other vendors ) my request is please don't join.Because you will end being nothing.Most of the product developement companies give the documentation andless important works to these kind of service companies.If you joined here you will get deployed these mokka(scrap) works.These companies uses their own tools for product development and you will be forced to work on these tools .In effect after two or three years you will use only those tools and your skills won't get updated as per the market level.When you come out of the organisation your market value will be nothing.If you ask for different role what they does is they will deploy in some other project where you will have to use some other mokka tools.Yes there are exceptions but it depends on your luck.99% of the people who joined in external project suffers.Client will treat you like a begger .They toss away all the scrap works to you and they will do the intresting work. Yes they offers a very good learning platform like isuccess learning but those courses are worst. I have gone through lot of them most of them are useless.Regarding the hike,there isn't even a hike There are 4 quarterly reviews to capture how good you performed in each quarter but it's just a fake game.Everyone in hcl gets almost same hike(usually 6-15%) I joined around 2019 with a fresher salary of 2.5LPA,Then got deployed to these scrap work .Somehow i got lucky .I influenced one of my customers they gave me some important work.Then i learnt and i left .But people who joined along with me are still there struggling to get exposure to market demanding skills.They are stuck and they are not getting any offers in thier hand.I left the organisation with a ctc of 2.6 LPA ie i got a hike of 10k for two years.my request to you is please investigate well and join Hcl",1,04-Mar-22,4,1,1,HCL Technologies,Software Engineer,1
1,"Worst, nightmare, terrible, horrific.",Pune,"There is nothing to like about working at HCL Technologies. It's one of the worst MNC company to work for. They notice period is of 3 months which is one of a big red flag. Few Sr. PM and PM's are worst here they torture you and make you work with pressure that surely you will be consulting doctors soon. It's a Nightmare when workingfor HCL Technologies. You can forget career growth here, managers do not release you easily from the project because of their own torturing satisfaction. Work life balance is worst here, make sure you get the right project otherwise you are screwed. Avoid IT work in banking projects that HCL Technologies handle. HCL Technologies will only hire you for their clients and not in house. The appraisal is worst over here just 5 to 7% yearly even if you are a top performer. New Joiners, ppl looking for jobs be aware of things that goes in HCL Technologies. Check all the red flags before joining HCL Technologies,otherwise you will have a nightmare and a horrific experience.",1,1,"Job security is ok here, would suggest to join HCL after 45 or 50 age, as there is no career growth prospects here in HCL.

2,Allways gets frustrating üò§ on job and in offer.,Noida,Never join this company if you want to grow. Read all my comments in like section and many more problem they but I think that is enough to understand.,1,3,"Only good thing is you will get salary on time every end of the month. Sometimes you will feel like security of the job. Keep deducting insurance premiums from your salary, before join HCL first read all section in offer letter because there is AMPB - Annual Monthly Performance Bobus they do include your fixed salary and theyprovide every monthly include in fixed monthly/yearly the problems is when you resign this company they will deduct that amount from your FNF amount and will hold your salary until all due cleared, supposed your monthly AMPB is Rs.8000 then multiply into LWD of the month then it will be total amount, AMPB start every year from April to March. They offer during job like they give offer for enrollment for academy learning and before you enroll you have to sign Service Agreement for 2 years and you can not leave the company with service agreement and you wish to leave then you have to pay back 2 lakhs. They have two/three/six months of the notice and option for buyout if you with to not serve notice period but Manager's never approve/allowed and until your manager does not leave from the project and compnay HR will not help on anything. No night allowance given in HCL They can give any project roll no matter what profile is yours it depends on project availability they can give Service Desk work for on-call support. Manager's allways harassing their people mostly the manager came from Service Desk Management Salary - forget about that you will get hike every year , they do nothing increases, There is called quarterly performance review , they will give allways good rating all quarter but at the end of year like annual review they will mark down your review with out having any reason. I will simply say do not join this company if you have wish to grow otherwise here all your wished and ambition will stop.",1,16-Nov-21,2,1,1,HCL Technologies,Remote Support Engineer,1
5,"Mixed bag. Massively under compensated, although recognized for whatever I have achieved so far. (:",Noida,"HCL isn't a good paymaster. The average growth is extremely slow, way below inflation levels and you are massively undervalued (when it comes to pay.) Additionally, HCL as an enterprise doesn't really consider marketing as a value driver - more as a cpst function- so we end up getting the far end of the stick in most compensation related benefits. Basically, you are, on an average about 40 percent undervalued when employed as a marketer. So the massive hike you get when switching, that's just your market correction. Also the layers of approvals which sometimes makes it impossible to get things done, especially if you are impatient and love results quickly.",1,3,"Incredibly talented mid management, if you are lucky, a brilliant and supportive business team. You'd love working for and with the team. You are accountable for your own success, so if you do your best, you will be satisfied. I had the fortune of working with an incredible mentor and team as well.

3,,Bengaluru/Bangalore,"No sense of belonging, career discussions or even interest in employees. The management and the organization need to work on themselves and their direct reports, invest time in their careers. I‚Äôve been a top performer and have been rated so. However, increments are the lowest inspite of the company doing well. There is no interest incareer development. Performance appraisal and increase cycles - ask before joining .. if you have worked for 3 years your increment will be given barely twice and the percentage will be that you get for less than a years work. Policies aren‚Äôt transparent. There is no night shift allowance. No COVID leave. So empathy for those effected. No bereavement leave. Yes, that‚Äôs correct. No empathy for the families effected.. on just keeps using the 18 annual leave and then going on a leave of absence; the organization or management don‚Äôt care. The HCL internal HRBP team is as good as non existent. There is an HR in the team to do the HRBP‚Äôs role. If you care about having some piece of mind and a good career, then you know what to do.

2,Very Terrible. Zero work life balence,Chennai,I hope this review should be helpful for people willing to do job in HCL. I personally see is that ther is no work life balance which is Zero. And the Manager and TL are horrible persons they do not give their ears to the employees and listen what they say and they will try to blame everything on the employee. Don't ever expect a good work life balance and the rapo and understanding between the management and employee is zero. Worst and terrible experience with this company. I don't want to compare with my previous employment because I can't even compare this company with this is upto this level that i can't even compare. The appraisal is even worst that a start up company. The very worst part is here they try to rum a process with one or two persons. And the process which I work is only me in the shift and they don't provide even a single day leave as they state that there is no one in the process so you cannot be provided leave. I personally don't recommend this company. And most common point the politics which happens in every MNC. Proper recognition will not be given who works sincerely.,1,1,There is no such thing that i like the work there because ther are no benefits provided to the employees and it is not employee centric,1,09-Apr-22,2,1,1,HCL Technologies,Senior Analyst,2
2,"My work kept me engaged for most of the time in my shift. I had to attend many meetings which sometimes resulted in my shift time to exceed. Being a quick learner, it was easy for me to learn new things for which I was always appreciated.",Greater Noida,"The company is 'Not at all employee-centric' and has policies which gives 'Zero Benefits' to the employees. They may give you appraisal which is also very low and then will also take back the money if you leave in between the appraisal cycle which is very disturbing. It's like you have to serve a bond even while experienced. Worst part is that you'll never receive even the near about salary which is mentioned in your CTC. They deduct a lot of the amount which is not even explained clearly and will take plentiful of work from you, leaving you depressed. No recognition being given even for your hard work. Your clients will appreciate you but your managers won't! No shift allowance given here. In my project, we had to stay on call for the complete shift, while working from home. Such hectic schedules are to be followed here. The company must start to think for its employees!",1,2,"The company has good working culture and also provides job security.

1,it was a CAD JOB. Management is more caring about the client and there is no work-life balance.,Bengaluru/Bangalore,"Manager and HR system is not transparent. If you are on a project also, you have to complete your JBC. Job training is just like time pass, because there will be no practical problem. If you are on a project and need to provide any training to you, they will arrange it on weekends, because if they will conduct it on weekdays there billing hours will be affected. HCL is full of greedy managers and HR who exploits the engineers. Big thing Forget about appraisal. I don't like the 90 days notice period,which is not negotiable. and variable salary system, which you will never get 100%. Thank you, but this is my personal experience.",1,1,"As per my experience, Job security is there but working environment is worse, you are like a slave. There is no transparency between management and HR. if you will ask for any policy, HR will say your manager should approve this and manager will say only HR can implement this. They will play game.

First I asked Internal job movement in Jul 2021 so my manager and Senior Manager asked me to stay for 6 months and in meantime they will promote me but this doesn't happened. Again on 10th Jan 2022 I asked for release from my Projectfor internal job movement and my manager said April 2022 onwards he will think for my release from project that means again my 6 months are gone for my release.

Secondly, it becomes boring unless you get other works where it requires learning and knowledge. If it contradicts your self-respect then that is not for you. Thirdly, Salary , if you have good amount of experience then only you can expect a good amount of salary. Management is somewhere not good, everything needs to be revolutionised there which I sensed. Because of this reason work load is constantly heavy or it keeps on increasing. Which in turn creates frustation amongst managers which redirects to people at work especially to whom they suspect. Last but not the least if you are working for promotion only that person will get promotion whom manager has eye upon and if you show off or continously contact with your work inshort politics.",2,2,"Job security, Brand name, coworkers were respectful especially towards women ..no loose comments just work and support.

1,Worst,Vijayawada,Pure politics,1,1,"Dear Students of Techbee, I hope this review is from one of the employee who worked for Training and staffing services First foremost point you need to keep in mind 1. HCL Techbee is offering IT engineer and Associate roles in this company asking students to join paying for 2 lakhs and gst tax 2,38,000 currently . They break ice stating this is the best opportunities at work place Before that ask them these questions 1. Since HCL is top 4 companies in terms of revenue Over 11 B and it's presence in 50+ countries why do they charge 2,38,000 from students stating candidate will be trained on software curriculum (which means Excel,access) works few concepts of programing and DBMS which cost less than 25k but why they charge 2.38L 2.When this program is in Australia they don't charge a single penny during 3 months which is foundation classes (if candidate feel ok of the curriculum then he goes ahead but here in India they ask you to go bank loan giving enough fake promises of not required to pay interest until u get job in HCL) which has raise my doubts on the program Since HCL is Hindustani computer limited company why they looting indian money rather they don't focus the same in Other countries bcz they feel Indians are fools 3. They even say who get 90% in course after one year of training will be reimbursement will be paid total fee (for God sake please ask who got 90% earlier and who been paid list) HCL will tell due to privacy concern we cannot do that but real fact is no one ever get 90% .Don't be as fooled as thinking I would get 90% in exam they won't allow u to cross 90% in exam the paper for intermediate candidates passout would be questioned on PHD range questions where even a doctrate cannot answer then how could a intermediate guy can pass?? So please come out of wrong notation 4. Guys don't ever think this exam to join Techbee is tough ..every candidate will get selected and provided with offer letter . I can give 100 reasons why not to join",1,31-Jul-21,1,1,1,HCL Technologies,Manager,1

If you complete work on time, you are unfit. You have to keep murmur that youhave 100s of activities and you have to send emails post your working hours to show off to get recognised. 3. If your boss recommends for promotion, HR can stop it due to bell curve theory. 4. Even if your boss relieves you from project after resignation, HR can ask you to serve full notice period. There is no room for buyouts. 5. Hike/Compensation is almost starting from single digit. 6. You have to get your pay hikes sorted during your joining. Do not expect good hikes. 7. No proper employee retaining policies.",2,3,1. Good learning environment. Its more suitable for 2 types of employees A. Freshers. B. Those who seek settlement. 2. Training modules are very good.,3,28-Aug-21,3,1,3,HCL Technologies,Product Regulatory Analyst,3
1,"Normal, not so exciting.",,Poor Appraisals. No growth opportunities. Politics by senior management. Cheap policies to stop attrition like recovering bonus from the salary of employees by holding their experience and relieving letters. They declared that bonus as a part of ctc and will come in monthly salary. And when you leave the organization they will ask you to give the bonus back else they will not give you the relieving and experience letters. They can change policies at any time and can apply it with a past date. For ex- they launch a policy on 18th November 2021 and the applicable date was 1st April 2021. Thats how they fool their employees with their cheap tricks. Don‚Äôt fall in their traps.,1,5,Nothing Much apart from job security they won‚Äôt give you anything like appraisals and growth opportunities even they can ask for whatever they gave you as bonus in your salary which is not exactly a bonus as it is a part of CTC.,1,17-Jan-22,5,1,1,HCL Technologies,Senior Analyst for 2.4 years in Noida,1

They can't give 1k to an Indian employee for RT-PCR, but they're OKAY to pay $99 to a employee working in the USA. Double standard organization. . Pure favouritism at the time of joining.

I am hoping to complete some 18 months just to be fair to my current team and then leave. Company policy look good on paper. But end of day it is pay.

1,"simply horrible. No work life balance at all, no peace of mind and extra hours work without flexibility or OT",Chennai,"I will urge everyone who are thinking of joining with HCL please read below points carefully then decide if you want to loose your peace of mind and career. 1. No HR Policies- This is one of the so called big IT who doesn't care about HR Policies, Ethics and Compliance, Value of it's own so called Policies. My case they have taken one month to provide release letter even after no dues and serving complete 90 days of notice Period. No one will help you from HR team neither during onboarding nor during release. There are many hidden things from HR side so read carefully your offer letter and ask them to change those terms without fail before accepting it. Like in my offer there was a terms APMB- Advanced Performance Monthly Bonus and guys please dont accept offer in case they are not willing to change this from your offer else you have to refund more than 25% of total salary you have received in the same appraisal cycle which they have given to you as APMB in case you are going to resign anytime before end of appraisal cycle even after Serving complete 90 days of notice Period you have to refund this which is really a illogical terms. Also they will hide many other things like actual PF deductions amount etc. 2. No work life balance and no shift allowance or OT - Management will monitor your every single click. You are not allowed to take any short breaks and have to work like machine for 12 hours shift. Need to join meetings outside of business hours and which will like buy one get one free hours. Every single day they will threaten you being layoffs in case if you are not willing to work extra hours. No night shift allowance, back to back weeks night shift, even need to stretch your shift after night shift also as they are always working with less than required resources. No OT allowance, no increment, no work life balance so you can join if you want to work like a machine. 3. Ridiculous BGV process.

Reaching out to your senior is a very tough job as they think they are the boss and not managers of the employees. Shift is for 10 hrs which utilizes the whole day as there is traveling included as well. You cannot change your job role within the company. For example if someone has joined the bpo sector doesn't even have the option to apply for any other job than of BPOs. If someone is in customer service and has a finance or HR degree then the person can not apply to the position as there is no clarity to where to apply from and no option available. HCL is an example of an Indian company. Not too employee centric. They should adapt work culture from other good MNCs. The notice period is of three months here and that too non negotiable People are stuck here because of this criteria.",2,2,HCL doesn't have too much work load All tasks are divided amongst many people to make the task more easy.

They will do all drama of employee care but nothing is real. Being worked there for 1.8 years thats my experience.You will work the best for a good future but these team leads and managers just care to show themselves smart to the higher management. After all hardships and the contribution to company you will get to know they took the credit and not in picture and when business is down a bit they say you need to be in bench and kick you out when time comes. HR will play good drama saying employee care and behind they will show their real face as adviced by senior management There only headcounts matter & not identifies your skill or passion. Performance analyse how a fish climb a tree and monkey swim in water. Thats HCL.,1,10-Aug-17,1,1,1,HCL Technologies,Technical Staff,1

1,I had worked on three projects. The first one was related with camera Ui for a Japanese client. I was incharge of processing info from client and distributing work and in the end making sure the code is of reasonable quality.,Noida,"HCL has little knowhow of software development and tools involved. since the culture is client loaded and with √†ttrition and no common knowledge base(as a bulwark against attrition), repeated knowledge transfer from the client was/is common. people are apprehensive to take the blame lest client raises a concern. so after a while, we were not allowed to know about the library on which we had to work. The tools were also inadequate. We had written c++ code in notepad because we were not allowed to install even free IDE. The network speed can hardly bypass 3G on a phone on a good day. I assume, they are throttling and analysing. Which is good but to have a umbrella level policy is demoralizing and puts in question the culture, HCL is embracing. Well non work related are also significant but had good software practices been followed, this would have been trivial. They over-optimised the process to the point that basic hyegine and wellbeing becomes questionable. No toilet paper in restrooms. I can't imagine shaking hands with one of the HCL fellows.

In terms of skill development and learning, I would like to say no company can develop your skill untill you are willing to. I was not interested in learning Engineering and I didn't learn because my institute didn't force me to learn. Over n all its your choice. Focusing on work life balance, basically it's up to you, How much you are capable to finish your work and enjoy your life, after all its your responsibility to finish your task. Work from home is available, so you could plan your calendar accordingly. Compensation and benefits, please don't expect much otherwise you will cry after the appraisal cycle :D... Lol ...

3,,Chennai,Appraisal and Growth both are snail pace !!,2,5,"HCL is very flexible and helps manage work-life balance. But it purely depends on the Manager and the capability of the employee. If you do your job and earn the belief of your Boss then everything is flexible and good !!! You will have a job satisfaction. Based on your project you will get a chance to learn more again it is based onyour interest and push !! The only biggest problem in Hcl is Appraisal/Hike. If an employee gets the highest rating once then even if he/she doesn't do that great next year they tend to give the same rating !! I just don't understand this logic !! It annoys others certainly. Variable pay doesn't come fully if you get even a decent rating. It is given 100% only for top ratings!! single digit hike upto 2 - 3% is all that you will get in Hcl...Mark my words!!! If your Manager is good and fights for you you would get maybe 4 - 5% otherwise it is a real chaos during appraisal !!! If you get a designation change no change in your hike percentage and that is so awkward !! Overall it is really painful to continue working in HCL with the same salary ...You can work for 3 years maybe and then shift !! One good thing is Insurance they cover for the entire family and it is at a higher percentage of coverage. We need not pay extra to include parents or in-laws..but bill payable by insurance is only 85%. I think that is ok !! At least they give a complete insurance coverage!!

I shouldn't have said this but what's the duty of an HR towards an employee- resolve employee's problem,to sought out things instead of helping me out with what I was suffering ... When I cried in front of him by explaining my problem his words were - "" ye Rona dhona mere saamne mat karo"" your Team lead said GET OUT OF THE FLOOR in front of everyone without even caring about the thing that he is talking to a girl .. still Hr's word were this 2. Worst Appraisal - come on this is the thing u cannot ask from HCL salary was already so low.. afterwards if u got good points during ur appraisal, salary increment will be of equal amount whether u worked better then the person who rarely completes his task 3.NO Growth - If u are working in a particular department... Though u are good in some other department and u wanted to move your team lead, your manager, won't approve that easily and in case they do that... Other department heads will not even arrange an interview for u... So for example if u are a technical graduate working in Bserv domain of hcl u cannot dream of getting in to ur field.. bczz there heads do not think u r even worthy of giving interview for that What do u want while working with an organization to grow, to earn better and with healthy environment...

For an year I was was with comnet but later on I had cracked an IJP which was of service desk lead of Nagpur location . When I had reached there I had demanded for my salary hike which was being promised in my IJP . I was surprised to see that a new hiredRM from a BPO promised me that in between we can't change your salary this year but later on the next year your salary will be hiked . Then I demanded for the designation then after 2 months they denied. I had gone to HR and raised this issue . But I was surprised that there is no result from them . I followed the chain and gone to the seniors . Even I had gone till company CEO for this issue . But I was surprised that for every mail I got a reply that we are looking for this issue very soon we will contact you and I had attached all the proves in the mail. Later I was mentally so depressed that they forced me to resign .,1,1,Firstly I had joined HCl Comment and was posted in client location.

There are many oldies and young ones who stay - talk behind your back. There is NO trust in the team and managers lie to prop up their favorites. Senior management is oblivious and desperate, because they are part of the problem; but see people as disposable. Do not waste your time here, it's a useless company. They make you work on holidays and weekends. And moreover if you have a personal work for even few minutes - they put an escalation with lies that you did not do your work.

If you are fresher and having good knowledge then please find another job. If your pkg. is around 2.8Lpa(HCL Infra) then they will treat you like labour. They make you to work for asset management(making entry of laptop and employee on excell sheet) or other non technical work which is useless for you. If your pkg. is around 3.5LPA(HCL Tech) then you have to do support work. Even in Noida 90% work is for Support only very less development projects are there. During the time of joining they will give you n numbers of offer but after joining no one will listen you. HR had taken 3 moth time to release my offer letter. Before joining i read the review but ignore them and join this company but after joining i am realizing that is my biggest mistake please don't repeat my mistake if you have any offer from startup or middle level company please join that company. Now i am searcing for new job as will get new job i will left HCL.

I love the fact that I am a part of a team that markets reliable, high-quality products and has a global client base. As a result, I get to travel abroad, especially to the US and Canada. But on-site travel is completely dependent on your project and client‚Äôs location. Mine is a US based client and they have some offices in Toronto, hence Another plus point is that my colleagues come from various cultural backgrounds, and we work happily in collaboration. I also like the employee re-hire policy here. Here we have a great opportunity to start our carriers Thanks",5,07-Sep-18,5,5,5,HCL Technologies,Quality Analyst,5

4,My Work at HCL is production support role on Oracle/Unix4. I really enjoyed the work sometimes it will be hectic but at any cost i never compromised because for me customer is God who is responsible for providing work to HCL.,,"As per my view HCL is one of the top mncs , but politics in the company made my life miserable my manager under whom I worked as I asked him release due to relocation to hyderabad city he along with his superior told me that they will screw me out of the company in case if I wont continue the project. so I looped there superiorand sent mail to them regarding my release date. Then they fixed my release date as july 4th. One more thing I observed my manager several times provoking me to check for opportunities outside HCL specifically when it is close to appraisal period but my intention is not to leave the company but only location change to hyderabad HCL but in bench i observed that he used to send some of my colleagues referring companies in bangalore. He himself told me why dont you resign and try for better opportunity outside, taken my joining dates as well in order to know bond time completion. I observed HR also completely supporting my manager without doing proper investigation. As I unable to bear push from manager directly/indirectly i dropped resignation on 10th August mentioning relocation to hyderabad city as reason. Though I dont like to leave so I withdrawn my resignation on 19th August 2018 and sent mail to my manager ""If any time i behaved rudely with you please forgive me"" he is still not convinced he is referring me some other MNC company what i observed in him is at any cost I need to leave HCL company. Though i dont like to leave HCL as I observed my manager only not allowing me to grow or relocate to hyderabad HCL city so i dropped resignation 20th August 2018 resignation as well approved immediately by the HR in 2 days. Generally any person who dropped resignation and withdrawn resignation he/she are eligible to apply resignation only after 3 months but in my case even if I apply resignation immediately approved. I know injustice so I observed that manager and HR had intention to send me out so i have resigned and came out.",4,4,"Work perspective i used to show lot of interest in providing services to the client involving in handling incident tickets,service requests,mails,tools, bridge calls etc Justification done for every rupee HCL is a brand across 31 countries so obviously there is chance of career growth scope to learn exhibit and explore things.so if there is any chance for me to work in hyderabad hcl i can give my 100 percent best to the company. As it is my home city i can invest some more office hours in order to deliver quality services to the client. Not only HCL it can be any company i wont compromise at work because for me my self satisfaction at work is important Why I had given job security as average because i came to bench for the purpose of relocating hyderabad HCL city but no opportunities are shown to me when certain things are not satisfied obviously employee had no chance HCL company had slogan ""Employee First Customer second"". Though i respected customer and provided quality deliverables to client ultimately company did not give any preparance to me infact resignation accepted in 2 days and came out. this is great betray which cannot even digest even now",4,11-Sep-18,3,4,4,HCL Technologies,Software Engineer for 2.6 years in Hyderabad,4

The business unit is full of incompetent people, and leadership is very well aware that the emperor is without clothes, but they don't say who is the emperor.No career progression for hardworking people, only way to get growth is to bad mouth about other teams as leadership (AVP and above) is only wasting all time in proving that the other teams are worse than them. The BU has done no work in 4 years, and everyone is only asked to create PPT by repurposing (copying) the proposition that some hardworking folks created and later left the company in dismay. The only silver lining is IoTWorks pays very handsomely as no one really wants to stay in Indian team due to exceptionally bad work culture, where leaders scheme behind team members to get their selfish interest done.

Make sure what designation or position is given to you by HCL, because at their client location you get surprised when you know exactly what is your designation and the job profile, also later you will come to know that yours and others designation is the same not much differences.Lastly, all I can say guys, make a wise decision and think rather just thinking like a no brainer.

I had learnt a lot during my tenure atHCL.What I like the best about sprint is involvement of senior collegue when we got stuck while processing the order for certain LEC'S.So overall I had explore a lot of new things which I will showcase when I will join the new organisation.It was totally life time experience that I had at HCL technologies, Noida.So being experienc employee I would like to tell my peers to join Sprint as an freshers there you can explore many new things which will boost your skills for future. Thank you.",3,05-Jul-21,3,3,4,HCL Technologies,Associate Engineer- Product Support,4

My 2019 appraisal was Unchanged - no clarity why it happened and who did this to me !!! It means Its just worthless working day and night and for one single person who manages the hike in the project I don‚Äôt even deserve 1% hike because He don‚Äôt know Me probably or find me hardworking enough to get a salary hike !!!

Since I was trapped in service desk operations I wasn‚Äôt getting opportunity to move out of SD ops. If I had to move out, I need to under a program and sign a bond which will allow change the track. I had another major concern, HCL didn‚Äôt release my revised salary structure for one whole year after I returned from on-site. There were plenty of back and forth emails but it took one year for me to understand my actual CTC. During this period I wasn‚Äôt getting transport so I spend thousands from my pocket for my daily commute. Also when i resigned they didn‚Äôt release my experience letter for more than 45 days and when followed up they came back saying I owe them 57 rupees. If you are know to be nice and friendly with your manager you have a better chances of growth (this is specific to the project I worked in).

It is my personal experience that managers just visit foreign countries for fun. The work is done by the bottom layer. I understand that you give chance to freshers, but for them you charge the client more, however, you do not pay the employee well. Peoplewho stay with HCL are either money making managers or someone who blindly follows the managers. Even if it is unethical. Whitleblower is not just for trainings they should be more investigative and powerful. Sometime I feel that the audit team is bribed.",1,1,"It is a place for politicians. If you are good at politics you can easily survive and thrive. Here you can find managers, not leaders. HR here does not have their own way of working. They do what managers tell them to do. Managers want you to do what they like, work ethics are not followed. Whistle-blower too seems to listen to managers. Hire freshers and portray them 2 levels higher in front of the customers. Charge more from the client and pay less to the employee. That is the mantra for building a 10 billion company.
